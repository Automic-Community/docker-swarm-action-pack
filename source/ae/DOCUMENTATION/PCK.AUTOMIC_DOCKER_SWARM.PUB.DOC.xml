================================
The cluster management and orchestration features embedded in the Docker Engine are built using swarmkit. Swarmkit is a separate project 
which implements Docker's orchestration layer and is used directly within Docker.
A swarm consists of multiple Docker hosts which run in swarm mode and act as managers (to manage membership and delegation) and workers (which run swarm services).
Can be used for:
. Clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers.
. IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system.
. Allows managing of Docker Cluster remotely.
